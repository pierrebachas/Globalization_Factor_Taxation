# Globalization_Factor_Taxation
Data and codes for the paper "Globalization and Factor Income Taxation", by Pierre Bachas, Matt Fisher-Post, Anders Jensen & Gabriel Zucman.

The paper assembles an extended time series of macroeconomic effective tax rates on capital and labor.
The data covers the 150 most populous countries from 1965 to present, with exceptions for command economy eras, pre-independence and civil wars, 

Users interested in using the effective tax rates data can download the data file: **globalETR_bfjz**
 
The construction of effective tax rates is detailed in section 3 of the paper and in the Online Appendix. 
Users interested in seeing their construction and/or changing assumptions can use the set of codes detailed in "ETR_0_master.do" 

In the coming months, we aim to make the raw data of tax revenue we digitized fully available, together with the country case studies which permit to validate the accuracy of different sources. In the meantime, users interested in obtaining specific countries' raw revenue data sources which we digitized can contact us. We also welcome anyone with access to tax revenue data which can improve or correct the series to contact us.
